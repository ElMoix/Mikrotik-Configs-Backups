# SCRIPT FOR BACKUPS

File **'mikrotikbck.sh'** it's a bash script used to export the config of mikrotik routers.
With this we have a backup and automatized system to retrieve all the important config.

You have to add your clients to the 'mikrotikClient.txt' file.
If you connect to your router via ssh with another port (that's not the default) you can also add it.

This script use the 'sshpass' tool.
You could also change it and make it with pub/priv keys.
So you don't need to have plaintext passwords in a file. It's up to you.

EXAMPLE:
```
root@backups:~# ./mikrotikbck.sh mikrotikClient.txt 
```

BEFORE DOING NOTHING:
```
The backups are saved onto the /home/mikrotiks/ directory. You must create it before.
Also it saves the logs onto the /var/log/mikrotik/ directory. You must create it before.
```

CRONTAB:
```
00 15 * * 5     /root/mikrotikbck.sh /root/mikrotikClients.txt
```
